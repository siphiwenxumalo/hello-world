I am Siphiwe Nxumalo, a young ambitious man who is IT driven and oriented, because everything these nowadays revolves around IT. I am originally from South Africa and stays in the South of Johannesburg at Naturena with a family of three. I completed my matric in 2007 in St. Matthews Private Secondary School which is based in Soweto at Rockville. I then took a gap year to raise funds for my tertiary education, thatâ€™s when thereafter I went to study for my IT Diploma at Damelin College based next to the CBD of Johannesburg in Braamfontein from 2011-2013 academic years and graduated in February 2014, where I obtained my National Diploma in Information Technology. I am looking for a company that offers growth and opportunities.  I believe that my expertise, and qualifications in Information Technology will make me a valuable asset to your organisation and, I would appreciate your careful consideration of my credentials as presented in the copy of my attached CV. My long term goal is to become an expert in Information Technology. I will add value to the company if I am given the opportunity to apply the skills and knowledge to continue to learn and grow.
